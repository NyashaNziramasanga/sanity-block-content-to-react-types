# sanity-block-content-to-react-types


Create a folder @types/@sanity in the root of your TS project.

Add `block-content-to-react.d.ts` to it.

When/if this gets better, I can try to move this to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)


Pull Requests, suggestions are welcome!
